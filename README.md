# README

For this project, it was helpful to review the controllers and views lessons:
- https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-controllers
- https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-views

I also needed the strong parameters information from the devise documentation:
- https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#strong-parameters

Google was helpful for any other roadblocks.
